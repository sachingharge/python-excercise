Write a parser for the template text provided. Each variable to be replaced in the template starts
with a dollar sign, and ends in a dollar sign. You should also implement handling of for-loops as you
can see in the example template. You should read the variables to use for replacement from the
given YAML file. Feel free to use any language and libraries you can find, but write the logic at least
for the for-loop handling yourself.
